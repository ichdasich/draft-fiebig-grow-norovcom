1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), specified in [RFC4271], is the
   protocol used in the Internet to exchange routing information between
   network domains.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Scope of the Document

   This is the scope.

3.  Definitions and Acronyms

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ASN:
      Autonomous System Number

   DFZ:
      Default Free Zone

   GRT:
      Global Routing Table

   NLRI:
      Network Layer Reachability Information

   In addition to the list above, the following terms are used with a
   specific meaning.

   BGP Speaker:
      A device exchanging routes with other BGP speakers using the BGP
      protocol

   BGP Neighbor:
      Also just 'Neighbor'.  Two BGP speakers that communicate using the
      BGP protocols are neighbors.

   Exporting a Prefix:
      Advertising a prefix to a neighbor.

   Operator:
      Individual, group of people, or organizational unit responsible
      for operating BGP speakers, i.e., making administrative changes,
      as well as defining and setting policies for all BGP speakers
      within an organization.

   Originating a Prefix:
      Advertising a prefix with an empty AS-Path.

   Router:
      In this document, router always refers to a BGP speaker.

4.  First section

   Section.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations missing.
